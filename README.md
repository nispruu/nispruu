- 👋 Hi, I’m @nispruu
I have a Masters in Computational Fluid Dynamics and a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I am curently woirking at Tata Technologies in Warwick.
Although, I do enjoy working with fluids and CFD, I am also interested in general concepts in Science, especially Physics
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning things I learnt in my Masters, its been quite a while and I've almost forgotten some concepts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who have worked as an aerodynamicist or a CFD Methodology engineer. I wish to acquire the skills they have.
- 📫 Reach me via email on nispruhags@gmail.com for any suggestions to improve my CFD skills.
